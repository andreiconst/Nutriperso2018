This github is a repository for the code used in the Kantar 2014 data study for the INRA. This work was done under the supervision of profs. M. Sebag and P. Caillou.\\

The code is organized into 4 folders, corresponding roughly to the introduction (preprocessing) + 3 parts of the report file. Although the 3 parts are somewhat independent from one another, it is necessary to run the preprocessing first, in order to put the data into an amenable format for any other part. Here, we will describe point by point each of the 4 code folders.

Before starting any analysis, note that the data folder is empty. Please put in the data folder the 2 following files:
1- achat_2014.csv (purchase data)
2- menages_2014.csv (data about households)
